      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Naan bread is a soft, pillowy flatbread with a hint of chewiness and
        light tang from yogurt or yeast. Traditionally cooked in a tandoor, this
        version is made on the stove, giving it a slightly smoky char. Brushed
        with butter or ghee, it's perfect for scooping up curries or enjoying on
        its own!

      <ol>
        <li>
          Mix the yeast and lukewarm water in a bowl and wait until bloomin to
          ensure the yeast is alive.
        </li>
        <li>Add about 10% of the flour to create a slurry.</li>
        <li>Add the oil, yoghurt and salt. Mix thorougly.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour and stir with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Once all the flour is incorporated move onto a floured surface.</li>
        <li>
          Work the dough for roughly 10 minutes, adding more flour if too
          sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 10 minutes you should have a slightly sticky, "glossy"
          doughball.
        </li>
        <li>Let rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size</li>
        <li>Divide into 8 similar size balls (rougly 70g each).</li>
        <li>Flatten out by hand.</li>
        <li>
          Cook in an oiled, medium hot pan. Until slightly charred spots start
          appearing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all the dough balls are cooked, brush each of them with some
          melted butter and optionally with some garlic and serve!
